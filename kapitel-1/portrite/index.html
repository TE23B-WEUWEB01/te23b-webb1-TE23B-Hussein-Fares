    <p>In Islam, Muḥammad (Arabic: مُحَمَّد) is venerated as the Seal of the Prophets and earthly manifestation of primordial divine light (Nūr), who transmitted the eternal word of God (Qur'ān) from the angel Gabriel (Jabrāʾīl) to humans and jinn.[2] Muslims believe that the Quran, the central religious text of Islam, was revealed to Muhammad by God, and that Muhammad was sent to guide people to Islam, which is believed not to be a separate religion, but the unaltered original faith of mankind (fiṭrah), and believed to have been shared by previous prophets including Adam, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.[3][4][5][6] The religious, social, and political tenets that Muhammad established with the Quran became the foundation of Islam and the Muslim world.[7]</p>
